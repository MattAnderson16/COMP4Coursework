\section{Introduction}

My chosen client is Michael Seamark; He is fairly experienced with working with computer systems and mainly uses a laptop to assist with his job and to surf the internet. However, he also uses an iPhone to check his emails and keep in contact with people through social networking sites.

\subsection{Define the current system}
Michael has requested that I produce a metering system which monitors gas, water and electricity consumption with several graphical outputs to represent the use and any possible savings with a way to convert between units. It should be able indicate the current cost for the consumption and predict future costs.
