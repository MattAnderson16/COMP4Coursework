##Overall Comments
Some evidence of a structured investigation but there are significant gaps that hinder understanding. Various areas need to be reconsidered and the detail level improved in others. Some objectives but many more could be identified.

##Layout

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||Coursework title?|
||Various tables need reformatting|
||Diagrams need to be smartened up|
||Some diagrams are too large|


##Introduction

###Client Identification

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Limited introduction to client (page 5)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Where has the section heading gone? (page 5)|
||More detail on role and interest in system required|

###Definition of Current System

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Limited description (page 5)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Unclear how monthly bills are used to show comsumption/predict future costs|

###Describe the problems

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Some indication (page 5)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Further issues?|

##Investigation (The Current System)

###Data sources and destinations

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Some indication (page 7)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Watch margins for tables|
||There are further pieces of data here and sources/destinations|

###Algorithms

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Some reasonable algorithms (page 8-10)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Use updated settings file from GitHub|

###DFDs (where relevant)

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Diagrams generally reasonable (page 11-12)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||No reason to have the overlapping labels here|
||Where has the section heading gone?|
||What about data stores|
||Where is your key?|

###Input Forms, Output Forms, Report Formats

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||Is this really a form?|
||What about example bill?|
||Page from notebook etc.|

##Investigation (The Proposed System)

###Data sources and destinations

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Table present (page 14)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||What do you mean by "gas consumption data"?|
||Are these values really going to go straight from the meters into the database?|
||Again, further possibilities here - what about the graphs?|

###DFDs (where relevant)

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Structure appropriate (page 14-15)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Again, the overlapping labels|
||Again, not sure about the meter giving data directly to the database|

###Data Dictionary

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Dictionary present (page 16)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Table needs further formatting|
||Watch your margins|

###Volumetrics

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Structure of calculate seems appropriate|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Where does the 200 records come from (page 16) - reference!|
||Calculation does not match fields listed in data dictionary|

##Objectives

###General Objectives

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Inidication (page 17)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Further objectives required|

###Specific Objectives

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Some objectives with SMART features (page 17)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Unclear which general objective these are sub-objectives of|
||Further objectives|

###Core Objectives

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||This section should be those specific objectives that MUST be achieved (page 18)|

###Other Objectives

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||This section should be those specific objectives that MIGHT be achieved (page 18)|

##ER Diagrams and Descriptions

###ER Diagram

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||Why are there three separate databases? (page 20)|
||Again overlapping labels|
||Are predicted and average readings stored or just calculated?|

###Entity Descriptions

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|||
|**Weaknesses**||
||Notation is incorrect (page 21)|
||No evidence of relationships|
||Will need reconsidered with revised diagram|

##Object Analysis

###Object Listing

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Limited indication (page 21)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Again, unsure that it is necessary to have all of these predicted/average objects|
||What about other objects - graphs etc.|

###Relationship Diagrams

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||This should contain all of the objects listed and no more (page 23)|
||Again, overlapping labels|
||This will need reconsidered based on feedback above|

###Class Definitions

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Generally acceptable notation (page 24-33)|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Why are these so large?|
||What are the square brackets for?|
||Again, will need to be reconsidered|


##Graphs (and Other Abstractions)

###Graphs

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||Section not included|

##Constraints

###Hardware

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Some considerations relating to screen resolution and power constraints (page 34)|
|**Weaknesses**||
|| |

###Software

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||So are there any constraints or not?|

###Time

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Deadline given (page 34)|
|**Weaknesses**||
|| |

###User Knowledge

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||So does this have an impact on how you will develop/design the system (page 35)?|

###Access Restrictions

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||More details needed (page 35)|

##Limitations

###Areas which will not be included in computerisation

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Indication given (page 35)|
|**Weaknesses**||
|| |

###Areas considered for future computerisation

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
|| |
|**Weaknesses**||
||Why is this not just part of the proposed system? (page 35)|

##Solutions

###Alternative Solutions

|**Strengths**||
|-|-|
||Some alternatives listed with advantages/disadvantages (page 360|
|**Weaknesses**||
||Again, table is going into the margins|
||little more description on each proposal|
